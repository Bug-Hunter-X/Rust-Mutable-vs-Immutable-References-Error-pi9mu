This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming related to mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through an immutable reference, resulting in a compile-time error.  The `bugSolution.rs` file shows the correct way to handle mutable and immutable references to avoid this error.
